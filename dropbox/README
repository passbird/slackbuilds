Dropbox (store, sync and share files online)

Dropbox is an extension that integrates the Dropbox web service
with your desktop. It consists of two major components: dropboxd
- a per-user closed-source daemon process that makes sure your
$HOME/Dropbox directory is properly synchronized with the web
Dropbox server/service, and dropbox-client, which connects to
your dropboxd and presents a GUI based on the information
dropboxd provides.
